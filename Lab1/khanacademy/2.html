        <em>Nobody’s born smart.</em> We all start at <strong>0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10</strong>.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</strong><br>
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing.</em> And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong>.<br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere can understand.</em><br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
